This is a game that I am working on called sylence written in C for Lynix.

I had an idea for a game that wouldn't use any graphics, and thought it could
be a good learning expereince. I am trying to build it completely from scratch
as I would get a better understanding of the underlying sytems and it would
allow me to do more customization.

This is my first time doing a project like this so it might not be done
optimally or conventionally and I am fine with that. I also want to acknowledge
that it is quite a large project so I might never actually complete it. The
main goal is just to learn and think about problems that I haven't previously
considered.

If you have any questions, comments, criticisms feel free to contact me.
